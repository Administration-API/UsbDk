Viewing Debug Trace
==============================================================================

UsbDk uses Windows WPP facilities to trace code execution.
Both debug and release versions of the driver contain trace points
that my be activated at run time. In order to activate and view traces
use tracing scripts from Tools/Trace subfolder of UsbDk source tree.

Getting Text Traces (for debugging, requires UsbDk driver's PDB file)
==============================================================================

* Copy Tools/Trace subfolder from the driver source tree to the target machine
* Copy UsbDk.pdb from corresponding build tree subfolder to Trace folder on
  the target machine, this should be done after each driver recompilation
  (i.e. Install_Debug\x64\Win7Debug\UsbDk.pdb for Windows 7 64-bit Debug build)
* Download dbgview from http://live.sysinternals.com/Dbgview.exe
  and put to Trace folder on the target machine
* Copy traceview.exe from WDK install location on build machine
  (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\Tools\x64\traceview.exe)
  to Trace folder on the target machine
* Run UsbDkTrace.bat script from Trace folder on the target machine
* Keep pressing ENTER until dbgview window appears on the screen
* Accept dbgview license (shown on the first run only)
* In case everything configured properly log in DbgView should look like:
  ...
  [UsbDk]UsbDkEvtDeviceAdd Entry
  [UsbDk]CRegText::Dump ID: USB\VID_46F4&PID_0001
  [UsbDk]UsbDkSendUrbSynchronously Send URB IRP Error 0xc00000bb(STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED)
  [UsbDk]UsbDkWdmUsbDeviceIsHub Cannot query device descriptor
  [UsbDk]UsbDkEvtDeviceAdd Exit 0xc00000bb(STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED)
  ...
* In case trace contains entries without format information, i.e.
  ...
  Unknown( 10): GUID=f07e9b42-334e-a0c9-a179-65db113c0bcc (No Format Information found).
  ...

  make sure correct PDB for your build and system was copied to Trace folder
  on the target machine.

Getting Binary Traces (for sending trace logs to developers, no PDB required)
==============================================================================

* Copy Tools/Trace subfolder from the driver source tree to the target machine
* Copy traceview.exe from WDK install location on build machine
  (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\Tools\x64\traceview.exe)
  to Trace folder on the target machine
* Run UsbDkTraceToFile.bat script from Trace folder on the target machine
* Press ENTER once
* Perform the scenario being traced
* Press ENTER a few times in UsbDkTraceToFile.bat console Window until it closes
* In case everything configured properly trace log will be saved to UsbDkTrace.etl
  file in the Trace foder

Converting Binary Traces to Text (requires UsbDk driver's PDB file)
==============================================================================

* Place the binary trace obtained (UsbDkTrace.etl) to Tools/Trace
  folder of UsbDk source tree
* Copy tracepdb.exe and tracefmt.exe utilities from WDK binaries location
  (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\bin\x64\)
  to Tools/Trace folder of UsbDk source tree
* Copy UsbDk.pdb that corresponds to the binary trace obtained to Tools/Trace 
  folder of UsbDk source tree
  (i.e. Install_Debug\x64\Win7Debug\UsbDk.pdb for Windows 7 64-bit Debug build)
* Run UsbDkTextLog.bat
* In case everything configured properly output should look like
  ...
  [UsbDk]UsbDkEvtDeviceAdd Entry
  [UsbDk]CRegText::Dump ID: USB\VID_46F4&PID_0001
  [UsbDk]UsbDkSendUrbSynchronously Send URB IRP Error 0xc00000bb(STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED)
  [UsbDk]UsbDkWdmUsbDeviceIsHub Cannot query device descriptor
  [UsbDk]UsbDkEvtDeviceAdd Exit 0xc00000bb(STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED)
  ...
* In case trace contains entries without format information, i.e.
  ...
  Unknown( 15): GUID=f07e9b42-334e-a0c9-a179-65db113c0bcc (No Format Information found).
  Unknown( 10): GUID=1cd39459-da07-54dd-2d59-4231cc92623c (No Format Information found).
  Unknown( 27): GUID=7a1906df-695f-0ca8-bad8-f8eac5a401a8 (No Format Information found).
  Unknown( 23): GUID=7a1906df-695f-0ca8-bad8-f8eac5a401a8 (No Format Information found).
  Unknown( 17): GUID=f07e9b42-334e-a0c9-a179-65db113c0bcc (No Format Information found).

  make sure correct PDB was provided.
