Crash dump types
==============================================================================

Three types of crash dumps can be saved on Windows:
1) Mini dumps: These are small (64 - 256KB) files. Due to their size, a lot of
them can be saved, but they are not particularly useful, especially without
the executable files that were running at crash time.
2) Kernel dump: this is a dump of the region in memory which is occupied by
the kernel. The size of such dump is usually few tenths of MB. These dumps are
very useful, because their size is small, and they contain the more relevant
parts of the memory.
3) Full dump: this is the dump of the entire RAM at the time of the crash.
While it contains all possible data, its size is equal to that of the RAM,
which is usually quite large.


Crash dump creation
==============================================================================

The crash dump (and crash handling) options on Windows are accessible at:
---
Right click on "My Computer" -> "Properties" -> "Advanced system settings"
-> "Startup and Recovery" -> "Settings".
---
In that menu, you would probably want to:
* De-select the "Automatically restart" option (so that the PC won't restart
  automatically after a crash).
* Choose "Kernel memory dump" from the drop-down menu.
* You can leave the dump file location at the default value, but may change
  that if needed.
* You can choose whether to overwrite the last dump file on the next crash.
  The default behavior is to overwrite, unless it's a minidump.

On the next crash (blue screen) a crash dump will be saved according to your
choices.

* The dump files are usually located in:
  * %windir%\memory.dmp
  * %windir%\Minidump\Minidump<timestamp>.dmp

* The option to permanently preserve old dumps can be also set by writing a
  DWORD "AlwaysKeepMemoryDump" with value 1 to the registry key:
  ---
  HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\CrashControl
  ---


Crash dumps on demand
==============================================================================

Crashes can also be initiated manually, to examine a status of a driver. This
is done via the registry, by setting a DWORD "CrashOnCtrlScroll" with the
value of 1 to the following two keys:
---
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\i8042prt\Parameters
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\kbdhid\Parameters
---
After setting these values, you can press Ctrl+ScrollLock+ScrollLock to get
a MANUALLY_INITIATED_CRASH (0x000000E2).

If a keyboard can not be accessed, a crash can be initiated using the
Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI) switch (or NMI signal on a VM).
To configure that, write a DWORD "NMICrashDump" with the value 1 to the
following registry key:
---
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\CrashControl
---

* Note: On some machines automatic system recovery should be disabled, and NMI
  should be enabled in the BIOS for this to work.


Sharing crash dumps with developers
==============================================================================

* Because of the large file size, and high compressibility, please compress
  the dump files before sending them.
* To analyze a crash that was supposedly caused by UsbDk, please provide the
  UsbDk binaries you were using, the program database (PDB) files, and the
  source code - in case of using an unofficial build.
