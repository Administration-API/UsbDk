    Red Hat USB Redirector Client (UsbDk) Design and Architecture
    =============================================================

Red Hat USB redirector client software consists of following modules:

  1. UsbDk.sys - Red Hat USB filter driver for redirected USB
     device interception and exclusive access acquisition.
  2. UsbDk.dll - Helper DLL to install, uninstall and configure
     USB filter driver.
  3. UsbDk.exe - Simple command line application for UsbDk.dll
     API usage demonstration and verification.

USB redirector client software is used by virt-viewer for USB devices
discovery and access as required for redirection purposes.

Kernel mode component (UsbDk.sys) design and functionality
----------------------------------------------------------

UsbDk.sys is both USB filter driver and generic USB device driver.
On installation it is being registered as USB filter driver and
system invokes it for each new USB device being discovered including
USB hubs. On invocation UsbDk.sys checks type of underlying device
and creates filter instances for USB hubs only.

Being a filter of USB hub UsbDk.sys receives all requests from upper
part of USB stack including enumeration requests that originated by
PNP manager (IRP_MJ_PNP/IRP_MN_QUERY_DEVICE_RELATIONS).

Upon enumeration request completion by USB hub driver UsbDk.sys scans
array of child devices returned and in case there are devices to be
redirected (according to current configuration) it creates special
"Generic Red Hat USB device" PDO and places it into the array returned
instead of entry being redirected.

As a result PNP manager doesn't see USB device being redirected, it sees
vendor specific USB device with RedHat IDs instead.

This vendor specific USB device created in special way (raw PDO) so that
system assigns the driver who created it (UsbDk.sys) to be the device driver
as well.

At this stage any request to this vendor specific device will be forwarded
to UsbDk.sys which in turn will patch and pass requests to/from original device
created by USB hub as needed.
